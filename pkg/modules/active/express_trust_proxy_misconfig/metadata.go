Detects Express.js trust proxy misconfiguration by sending X-Forwarded-* header variants
and comparing responses against a baseline to identify behavioral changes.

When Express.js has ` + "`trust proxy`" + ` enabled without proper validation, attackers can
manipulate X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-For, and X-Forwarded-Port
headers to cause protocol confusion, IP-based access control bypass, and port injection.

## Notes
- X-Forwarded-Proto can cause redirect loops or strip Secure flags from cookies
- X-Forwarded-Host can be trusted for URL generation, leading to host-based attacks
- X-Forwarded-For can bypass IP-based rate limiting or access controls
- X-Forwarded-Port can inject unexpected ports into generated URLs and redirects
- Compares each probe response against a baseline to detect behavioral changes
- Host reflection is re-confirmed with a fresh random canary each round (must
  track the header value, not a coincidental static string); port reflection
  must be absent from the no-header baseline and reproduce on replay
