**How it's exploited:** An attacker (or prompt-injected agent) supplies a malicious URI to resources/read, reading /etc/passwd or secrets, or fetching cloud-metadata (169.254.169.254) to harvest credentials and pivot inward. Confirmed by file-content markers absent from the baseline or an OAST callback.

**Fix:** Allowlist the schemes and paths resources/read may dereference, reject file:// and traversal sequences, and block internal and metadata addresses.`
