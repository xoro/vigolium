**How it's exploited:** After the initialize handshake, a wordlist of method names (debug/info, admin/users, system/exec) is sent, flagging any returning a result or rejected with an error other than -32601 method-not-found. An attacker uses this to probe for disclosure or privileged actions.

**Fix:** Remove or properly authenticate undocumented debug, admin, and internal methods, and return -32601 for any method not meant to be publicly callable.`
