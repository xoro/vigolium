Found via static analysis of inline and same-origin scripts.

**How it's exploited:** An attacker sends a crafted link like ?__proto__[polluted]=true; the polluted property flows into a gadget (innerHTML, eval, document.write), typically yielding DOM-based XSS or auth-logic bypass. Identified statically, so verify manually.

**Fix:** Avoid recursive merge of untrusted URL input, strip __proto__ and constructor keys, and use Object.create(null) or Map for parameter stores.`
