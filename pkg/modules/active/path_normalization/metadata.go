Tests for path normalization vulnerabilities by iteratively applying traversal payloads
(with conditional auto-slashing) and checking response status codes and fingerprints
against expected internal/public patterns.

## Notes
- Compares response fingerprints between public and internal path variations
- Uses iterative payload application with auto-slashing heuristics
- Targets middleware and reverse proxy path normalization inconsistencies
- Requires the backed-off path to actually reach a resource (2xx) and to
  reproduce, so a host's generic 403/404/500 handling for malformed paths is not
  mistaken for an internal resource
