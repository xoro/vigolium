**How it's exploited:** An attacker initializes a session and sends empty-prefix completion/complete requests against each argument and placeholder; the server replies with the value lists verbatim, seeding follow-on access via resources/read and prompts/get.

**Fix:** Require authentication for completion/complete and avoid returning sensitive value sets; restrict completions to non-sensitive hints or disable the capability where it leaks private data.`
