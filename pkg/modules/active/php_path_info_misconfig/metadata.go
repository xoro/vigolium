Tests for PHP-FPM/CGI PATH_INFO routing misconfiguration (cgi.fix_pathinfo=1)
where requests to non-existent PHP scripts with PATH_INFO are routed to a
different script. This can enable authorization bypass or unintended script
execution by appending arbitrary paths to valid PHP endpoints.

## Notes
- Runs once per host to avoid redundant probing
- Sends requests to deliberately invalid script paths
- Compares responses to establish if PATH_INFO rewriting is active
- Drops catch-all hosts: a candidate 200 whose body matches a random
  "*.php"/PATH_INFO control (similarity-tolerant) is a blanket SPA/rewrite
  handler, not real cgi.fix_pathinfo routing
- Low false positive rate due to multi-step validation
