// match) for it to be treated as a chunk of encoded binary — an inline data:
// URI image, embedded font, or asset blob rendered into the page — rather than a
// standalone secret literal.
//
// A genuine credential is a bounded token: it sits between delimiters (quotes,
// =, :, &, ?, whitespace, line breaks), so it has ~0 base64 characters glued
// onto it as a prefix or suffix. A generic fixed-length / high-entropy token
// rule (e.g. ZeroTier's [A-Za-z0-9]{32}) matching mid-stream inside a large
// base64 image instead has hundreds of thousands. 160 leaves a wide margin: no
// real delimited secret carries 160 unbroken base64 characters as padding, while
// every encoded blob clears it by orders of magnitude (and an RS256 JWT
// signature substring — also a false positive — is caught too).

// isBase64FamilyByte reports whether b belongs to the base64 / base64url
// alphabet (including padding). These are exactly the bytes that make up an

// quotes, ., :, &, ?, , — delimits a real token.

//
// This is a dominant false-positive class for generic fixed-length / high-
// entropy token rules: a 32-character [A-Za-z0-9] pattern will match somewhere
// inside almost any large base64 image, so a benign 4xx error page that ships a
// branded inline graphic gets reported as a leaked API token. Dropping the match
// by its surrounding bytes — rather than by status code or content type — means a
// genuine secret served in the same response is still reported.

// it returns false (keep the finding), so it never drops a match it cannot
// positively explain.
