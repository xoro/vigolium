const googleAPIKeyDescription = `**What it means:** A Google API key (the AIza… family — Maps Platform, Gemini, Firebase, or a generic Google Cloud key) is served in this response. These keys are routinely embedded in client-side code by design, so exposure alone is not account takeover.

**How it's exploited:** The risk is billing and quota abuse. If the key carries no application restriction (HTTP referrer, IP, Android, or iOS) and is enabled for billable APIs — Maps Platform (Geocoding, Directions, Places, Static Maps, Distance Matrix) or Gemini/Cloud APIs — an attacker calls those endpoints at scale to run up the owner's bill or exhaust quota, a financial denial of service. HTTP referrer restrictions are weak: the Referer header is attacker-controlled and trivially spoofed, so a web-restricted key is often still abusable server-side.

**Fix:** Restrict the key to the specific APIs and applications it needs, and rotate it if it is unrestricted. Confirm exposure by probing one billable endpoint (e.g. Static Maps or Geocoding) — a valid response instead of REQUEST_DENIED proves the key is callable.`

const googleOAuthClientIDDescription = `**What it means:** This is a Google OAuth client ID (the NNNN-xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com identifier) — the public half of an OAuth client. Client IDs are embedded in every Google sign-in button and OAuth redirect flow by design, so their presence in a response is expected, not a leaked credential. The sensitive half is the paired client secret, which is reported separately when present.

**How it's exploited:** Nothing on its own. A client ID cannot authenticate or authorize a caller; it only identifies the OAuth application. It becomes useful to an attacker only when paired with a leaked client secret, refresh token, or access token (each its own finding) — check this same response for those, as a leaked client ID often sits beside them.

**Fix:** No action is required for the client ID itself. Ensure the paired client secret, refresh tokens, and access tokens are never served in client-facing content; if any of them appear alongside this client ID, rotate them immediately.`

const recaptchaSiteKeyDescription = `**What it means:** This is a Google reCAPTCHA site key. Site keys are public by design — they are embedded in page HTML/JS so the browser widget can render, and Google's model expects them to be visible. The server-side secret key that verifies tokens is the only sensitive half of the pair and is not present here.

**How it's exploited:** Nothing directly. A site key cannot bypass reCAPTCHA, forge verifications, or impersonate the site; it is reported for awareness only.

**Fix:** No action is required for the site key itself. Ensure the paired secret key is never exposed in client-facing content.`
