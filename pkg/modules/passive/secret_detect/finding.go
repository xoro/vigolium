// SecretDedupKey builds the identity used to collapse duplicate secret findings:
// the same secret value (snippet), from the same rule, on the same URL is the
// same leak no matter how many times it is re-observed. The same page is fetched
// across discovery, spidering, targeted re-spider, and the dynamic-assessment
// baseline, so the passive module buffers — and Kingfisher re-matches — it once
// per pass, yielding several findings that differ only by a few dynamic bytes in
// the body. Deduping on (host, url, rule_id, snippet) keeps one finding per unique
// secret per URL, which stops near-identical request/response copies from piling
// up as redundant Additional Evidence when the storage layer later merges them.
// The same secret on a *different* URL keeps a distinct key (and is grouped by
// value later if warranted).

// paths — the passive module's batch flush and the known-issue-scan batch — so
// the two can't drift in title, tags, evidence, or metadata (they already did
// once: one path titled findings by rule ID, the other by rule name). Callers
// set the source-specific fields (ModuleID, ModuleType, FindingSource,
// ModuleShort, and any extra tags) on the returned event.
