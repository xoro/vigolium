Sourcemaps map minified bundles back to original code, so leaving them reachable exposes source structure, file paths, and (with sourcesContent) full source.

**How it's exploited:** An attacker fetches the .map file to reconstruct the unminified source, revealing directory layout, internal API endpoints, and hardcoded secrets, accelerating reverse engineering.

**Fix:** Do not deploy sourcemaps to production, or restrict access to .map files; strip sourceMappingURL comments and disable sourcemap generation in production builds.`
