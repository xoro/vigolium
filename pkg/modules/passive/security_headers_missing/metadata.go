Passively detects missing or weak HTTP security headers that protect against
common web attacks including XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, protocol
downgrade, and referrer/cache information leakage. Related header-hardening
checks are consolidated into a single informational finding rather than separate
low-severity findings.

## Notes
- Checks for X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, and Permissions-Policy
- Flags missing or weak Referrer-Policy values (unsafe-url, no-referrer-when-downgrade)
- Flags sensitive HTTPS responses (Set-Cookie or password field) lacking Cache-Control: no-store/no-cache/private
- Runs per-host to avoid duplicate findings
- Only flags HTML responses to reduce noise
