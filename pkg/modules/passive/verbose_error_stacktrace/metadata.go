**How it's exploited:** An attacker triggers errors and reads the trace to map the directory layout, framework, and language stack (Go, Java, Python, Node.js, .NET, Ruby, PHP), then targets version-specific exploits, locates sensitive files, and crafts follow-on attacks like path traversal or injection.

**Fix:** Disable debug and verbose errors in production, catch exceptions to return generic error pages, and log full stack traces server-side only.`
