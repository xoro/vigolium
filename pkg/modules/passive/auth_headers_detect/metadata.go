**How it's exploited:** The disclosure maps which endpoints need authentication. If the credential is leaked, logged, or sent over a weak channel, an attacker who recovers it replays it to impersonate the user.

**Fix:** Treat Authorization values as secrets: keep them out of logs, caches, and URLs, send only over TLS, scope and expire tokens, and rotate exposed credentials.`
