// Package bin embeds the vigolium-audit host binary into vigolium and
// extracts it to a per-user cache directory on first use.
//
// The binary is built from platform/vigolium-audit/ by `make update-audit`,
// which runs `bun run build` and copies the host-platform output to
// _bin/vigolium-audit. Cross-compiling vigolium requires staging the
// matching vigolium-audit-<os>-<arch> blob at _bin/vigolium-audit before
// `go build`; the release does this per-target via the goreleaser pre-hook
// build/scripts/stage-audit-blob.sh (builds run with --parallelism 1 because
// the embed path is a single shared file). verifyBlobForHost (verify.go)
// guards against a wrong-platform blob slipping through at runtime.

// binFS holds whatever lives under _bin at compile time. `all:` lets the
// embed directive match an empty _bin (only the tracked .gitkeep) on
// fresh clones — missing-binary surfaces as a runtime extract error
// rather than a build failure.
