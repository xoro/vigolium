# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.1.15-beta] - 2026-05-28

Make `--format jsonl` emit the same post-scan, project-scoped `{"type":...,"data":...}` envelope as `vigolium export` (instead of the live nuclei-style stream) across scan, scan-url phase mode, and stateless runs; default stateless multi-target scans (`-S -T file`) to a single unified output file with new `--split-by-host` to opt into per-host files; surface timed-out modules in the scan status line (`X/Y (A active, P passive, T timed out)`); make failed scans exit non-zero and skip the "completed" banner instead of logging at INFO; accept `--session`/`--session-file` as aliases for `--auth`/`--auth-file`; and fold phases, intensities, and agent modes into `vigolium strategy` (dropping the `ls` subcommand).

## [v0.1.14-beta] - 2026-05-25

Publish multi-arch Docker images: `make docker-publish` now builds and pushes both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (override via `DOCKER_PLATFORMS`) as a single manifest using `docker buildx`.

## [v0.1.13-beta] - 2026-05-24

Make `--scanning-max-duration` cap total scan wall-clock time (all phases combined), widen severities to all levels for single-phase known-issue-scan runs, and add `cve`/`kis`/`known-issues` phase aliases.

## [v0.1.12-beta] - 2026-05-24

Bound the known-issue-scan phase to its `max_duration` and default it to critical+high severities.

## [v0.1.11-beta] - 2026-05-24

Initial release of Vigolium open source.
