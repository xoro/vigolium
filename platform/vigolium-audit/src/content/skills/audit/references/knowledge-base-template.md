# Knowledge Base Report Template

Unified template for `vigolium-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`. This is the single knowledge repository
for the entire audit — populated incrementally across phases 1-7. Each section is labelled with
the phase that produces it. Sections left blank by earlier phases are filled in by later ones.

For re-audit: load the existing `vigolium-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md` as the starting point. Update
only the sections whose source inputs have changed since `last_audited_commit`. Sections that
do not need updating are preserved as-is and their phase status is marked `reused`.

---

## Component Inventory

*Phase 1 — cve-scout. Full machine-readable inventory in `vigolium-results/attack-surface/sbom.json`.*

General "SBOM"-style catalog of **every software component the target directly relies on** — not just lockfile packages. Categories: `runtime`, `package`, `framework`, `datastore`, `external-service`, `container-os`, `build-ci`, `binary`, `vendored`.

| Component | Category | Version | Purpose | Security-relevant? |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|--------------------|
| <name> | <category> | <version / unknown> | <what it does> | <yes / no> |

**Counts:** total <N> — <per-category breakdown, e.g. runtime: 2, package: 41, framework: 3, datastore: 2, external-service: 5, container-os: 4, build-ci: 6, binary: 3, vendored: 1>

**Coverage gaps:** <categories not enumerable — e.g. no Dockerfile, versions inferred from ranges>

---

## Key Dependencies

*Phase 3 — threat-modeler. Curated security-relevant subset of the Component Inventory above (seeded from `sbom.json`).*

| Dependency | Version | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| <name> | <version> | <what it does> | <known CVEs, end-of-life, etc.> |

**Dependency intelligence notes:**
- <which dependencies are outdated or security-relevant>
- <which are reachable from the high-risk DFD/CFD slices>
- <which remain hypotheses until exploitability is established>

|------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----|
| <component or flow> | <good / partial / weak> | <none / CodeQL / Semgrep / both> | <wrapper, custom transport, policy flow, generated code> |

---

## Phase 4 CodeQL Extraction Targets

*Phase 3 — threat-modeler*

For each high-risk DFD slice, specify the expected CodeQL source type and sink kind so structural
extraction is scoped correctly. Leave blank if no DFD slices were identified.

| DFD Slice | Expected source type | Expected sink kind(s) | Threat model needed |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| <slice name> | RemoteFlowSource / LocalUserInput / EnvironmentVariable | sql-execution, command-execution, file-access, etc. | remote / local / env / all |

## Notes for threat-modeler

- This file is the single persistent knowledge store across all phases. Write to it incrementally.
- Read actual source code, not just the README.
- Threat scenarios must reference real code paths.
- Spec detection must cite the file/class that implements the spec.
- DFD/CFD sections should stay compact and risk-prioritized, not exhaustive.
- Leave later-phase sections blank initially (mark with *Phase N* label); they are filled in by those phases.
- Do not perform compliance gap analysis — that is Phase 9's job.
- The `## CodeQL Structural Analysis` section (including diagrams) is populated by the Phase 4
  static analyzer, not by the threat-modeler. The threat-modeler's contribution
  is the `## Phase 4 CodeQL Extraction Targets` section only.
- For re-audit: preserve all original section content. Update sections whose source inputs changed.
  Mark unchanged sections as `[reused from <short-sha>]` at the section header.
