/**
 * Always-present directive injected into `vigolium-results/audit-context.md` by every
 * CLI entry point that launches a mode (claude/codex handoff, interactive
 * `-i` exec). Each command-def's Context section inlines this file via
 * `!cat`, so the agents see it on their first turn.
 *
 * Policy: the user's invocation of `vigolium-audit run --mode <m>` IS the
 * authorization. Agents must not freelance text-based confirmation prompts,
 * regardless of whether `AskUserQuestion` is available. When the mode spec's
 * Pre-Flight Check would normally ask via `AskUserQuestion`, the default is
 * "Start fresh" — re-invocation signals the user wants a fresh run, not a
 * resume. Resume is opt-in via the explicit `--resume` flag; when that flag is
 * present, writeAuditContext uses RESUME_CONFIRM_SECTION instead.

  `## Auto-Confirm Default — Invocation Is Authorization\n\n` +
  `The user invoked this mode deliberately by running \`vigolium-audit run --mode <m>\`. ` +
  `That invocation IS the authorization for the entire run. Do not seek further ` +
  `confirmation under any guise — whether or not \`AskUserQuestion\` is available, ` +
  `whether or not a human appears to be watching the stream.\n\n` +
  `**Forbidden behaviors (zero tolerance):**\n` +
  `- Do NOT emit a freelance text-based confirmation prompt — no "Two options: 1. ... 2. ...", ` +
  `no "Before I kick off … I need your confirmation", no "Should I proceed? (yes/no)", ` +
  `no "Which would you like?" with numbered choices. If the spec doesn't explicitly require ` +
  `a stop, you MUST proceed.\n` +
  `- Do NOT stop to surface concerns about cost, duration, scope size, code drift, ` +
  `model attribution, stale working artifacts, or whether the user "really wants" the mode ` +
  `they invoked. The orchestrator already accepted those trade-offs by launching this run.\n` +
  `- Do NOT propose alternative modes ("Downshift to balanced / lite?"). The user picked this ` +
  `mode; honor it.\n` +
  `- Do NOT invent side effects the spec forbids — in particular, do NOT create or check out ` +
  `an "audit" branch, do NOT \`git checkout\`/\`git switch\`/\`git commit\`/\`git push\`. ` +
  `The mode spec is explicit: stay on the current branch and write everything under \`vigolium-results/\`.\n\n` +
  `**Required defaults when the spec's Pre-Flight Check would normally ask via \`AskUserQuestion\`:**\n` +
  `- Existing \`vigolium-results/audit-state.json\` (in-progress or complete): pick **"Start fresh"** — ` +
  `delete the existing \`vigolium-results/audit-state.json\` and proceed with Pre-Audit Setup. ` +
  `Re-invocation of the same mode signals the user wants a fresh run, not a resume. ` +
  `(Resume is only entered via the explicit \`--resume\` flag, which the CLI handles before ` +
  `this prompt ever runs.)\n` +
  `- Any other resume-vs-fresh / scope-confirmation / model-attribution choice: pick the option ` +
  `marked "(Recommended)" if any, else pick the option that **continues the audit**.\n\n` +
  `- Clean up stale working state per the mode spec (e.g. \`findings-draft/\`, ` +
  `\`probe-workspace/\`, \`chamber-workspace/\` from prior rounds) and continue.\n` +
  `- Only stop if a hard precondition genuinely cannot be satisfied (e.g. target directory ` +
  `unreadable) — in that case fail loudly with an explicit error rather than waiting for input.`;
